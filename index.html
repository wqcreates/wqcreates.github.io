        <h2>Hello, I am Wei Qiang</h2>
        <p><br>I am a game developer from Singapore.<br><br>I've expressed an interest in game design since an early age of 13. Having enrolled in game design schools widened my
            eyes to the world of game development as a whole. By tapping into the schools' and the internet's resources, I was
            equipped with the relevant skills to create game prototypes of my own! As a well-rounded passionate game developer, I
            wish to expand my knowledge of game development, learning and sharing with other developers!
            <br><br>I am equipped with a wide range of development skills like C#, javascript, and Python. My proficiency lies in Unity, where I have more than 5 years of experience in. I have also been using software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, and Autodesk Maya in my game development journey, and I am currently learning how to use blender.
